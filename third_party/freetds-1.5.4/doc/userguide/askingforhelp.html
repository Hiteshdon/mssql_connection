and attach the log to your message.
The logs are quite detailed, so make your query as short as possible.
If necessary, trim the log; <span class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span> is also your friend here.
It's always a good idea to post it on a website where people can fetch it if they're so inclined.</p><p>Log files are especially important if you're not programming at the C level.  Sometimes there are problems — an impedance mismatch, to coin a phrase — between <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span> and the calling framework/language.  But if you write to the list and say <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Why does my <code class="literal">PHP foo()</code> returns an empty string?</span>”</span>, please keep in mind that your question might as well be in Urdu to someone familiar with the C library.  Without knowing which C function was called, and with what data, it's impossible to even begin to try to answer the question.  </p><p>Think about it this way: If you attach a log no one reads, you wasted some bandwidth.  If you don't attach one and someone asks you for it, you wasted a day.  Like that.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ShowYourWork"></a>Show your work</h3></div></div></div><p>Great questions make the problem crystal clear to a tired developer after supper.  </p><p>Show what you did, and show what happened.  Throughout this User Guide, you've seen examples of screenshots; in each case the first line was the command entered, followed by the machine's response.  By showing <span class="emphasis"><em>verbatim</em></span> what you did and saw, you give someone who knows what to do a chance to look over your shoulder.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Across the Internet!</em></span>  How cool is that?   </p><p>Whether you're having a problem with your own application or with something at a higher level, you're well advised to try to reproduce it using one of the <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span> utilities, preferably one that used the same client library you're using.  If, say, <span class="command"><strong>bsqldb</strong></span> works and your program doesn't, that's a clue.  By the same token, if <span class="command"><strong>bsqldb</strong></span> exhibits problems, too, chances are you found a bug.  Or — how to say it? — a <span class="emphasis"><em>missing feature</em></span>.  It's always good to know about those.  </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="mailinglist.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="help.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="contrib.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Mailing List </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 10. Helping</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
