Unfortunately it had a few problems.  The original release was <span class="symbol">a.out</span>-based, although Greg Thain did a great service in converting the library to ELF.  Secondly, it included only the newer <code class="systemitem">CT-Library</code> <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>.  The older <code class="systemitem">DB-Library</code> <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> was missing.</p><p>Brian Bruns, a Sybase DBA and originator of the <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span> project, had some <code class="systemitem">DB-Library</code> programs he wanted to run under Linux, and thus began the <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span> project. The original work focused on <code class="systemitem">DB-Library</code> and version 5.0 of the protocol, but quickly expanded to include a <code class="systemitem">CT-Library</code> compatible layer and <acronym class="acronym">TDS</acronym> version 4.2.  Later support for <code class="systemitem">ODBC</code> and <acronym class="acronym">TDS 7.0 and 7.1</acronym> was added. Craig Spannring wrote a Java  <acronym class="acronym">JDBC</acronym> driver which became <span class="productname">FreeTDS/JDBC</span>.</p><p>As the project matured, it gained new participants.  Frediano Ziglio greatly expanded the <code class="systemitem">ODBC</code> driver, and continues to improve both it and the underlying TDS library.  Bill Thompson wrote most of the present BCP system and added cursors to our <code class="systemitem">CT-Library</code>.  James K. Lowden joined the project to add documentation, and in 2002 became its maintainer.  Such are the rewards for doing a good deed.</p><p>There have been many other contributions.
